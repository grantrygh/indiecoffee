		<h1>Welcome to the Indie Stage</h1>

		<p>
		We've hosted an eclectic mix of acts on our terazzo stage, from the well-known to the obscure, to everything in between.  Rousing performances by Clem Snide frontman Eef Barzeley (above) packed the house.  A surprise acoustic set from Jason Mraz brought a swarm of giddy fans to our intimate venue.  Many, many repeat appearances by the likes of critic favorite The Heligoats and crow-pleaser Jason Anderson have delighted our audiences.
		</p>

		<p>
		Hosting nationally touring musical acts of all sorts is our mainstay, but we do our fair share of indie film screenings (political films have packed the place), rock-and-reads, and fringe acts (such as a throat-singer/animal mimic, and a scrap metal percussion band).  
		</p>

		<p>
		We usually bring in acts that are solid and well-reviewed.  But sometimes we'll go out on a limb, simply because we like something and are curious.
		</p>

		<p>
		Bands love to play here.  The acoustics are quite good, and the intimate space lends itself to a rapt, attentive audience.
		</p>

		<p>
		All of our shows are free; however, we will ask for donations for the touring acts that really should get compensation.  Our policy is to give 100% of proceeds to the band.
		</p>

		<p>
		Why not check out our next event?  We're not a bar, but we do serve Wisconsin mircobrews and other libations.  And waffles.  Don't forget the waffles.
